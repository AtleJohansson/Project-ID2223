# ⚡ Electricity Price Forecasting – Frontend Dashboard

This repository contains the **frontend and user interface** for an electricity price forecasting project developed by **Atle Johansson** and **Robert Bromans** as part of **ID2223 – Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**.

The application is built with **Streamlit** and serves as a visualization and exploration layer for the project. It displays historical electricity prices, city-specific weather features, and model-generated price forecasts retrieved from the **Hopsworks Feature Store**.

The dashboard is designed to showcase the results of the serverless machine learning pipeline, provide transparency into the data used by the model, and present electricity price predictions in a clear and interpretable way.
